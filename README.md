 [Original colour pallete test using coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/05668d-427aa1-ebf2fa-679436-a5be00)
    
    Discussing the colour palette allowed us to think about the our audience and who it would appeal to, this was a first demo and we decided that muted coolours would be better suited as the greens came across quite aggressive and didn't communicate our concept as well as it could have done.
 [Final colour pallete test using coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/49c6e5-54defd-fffbfa-00bd9d-8bd7d2)
   
    We believed that this colour palette situated itself better with our concept and theme. The meanings behind the colours blue and green refer to harmony and prosperity. The blue tint evokes trustworthiness and wisdom.

## Accessibility
---

## Design Choices
---
* The design choice was dictated by my ability to use the knowledge gained from the first module of the course. While presenting challenges, it allowed me to achieve a further growth in understanding of the concepts taught better.
* From the start of the program, I aimed to design a website that covers in detail concepts taught in the module.

### Font
---
* Sans-serif
    * Evokes a clean minimal style, keeping it friendly and modern.
* Exo-Bold and Helvetica
    * The logo utilised two different fonts to keep it stylised and eye catching.
## Technology, Frameworks and Programs
---
### Languages
* HTML
* JavaScript

* CSS

* API

### Frameworks and Programs

* Materialize
    * Being something new, this initially came with it's challenges. As the team was more comfortable with CSS. At first it was believed that the colour selection in Materialize was quite restrictive, however, during a team talk we worked out that this can be overridden. We learnt that it acts as a template that uses industry standard assets and it allowed us to save a large amount of time to achieve the visual features that we wanted. 
* Github and IDEs included Gitpod and VSCode
    * Storing repositories and manipluating code cross party
* Slack
    * Video calls and messaging, allowing the team to keep communication free flowing
* Balsamiq
    * creating wireframes to plan our project
## Bugs
---
* Radio buttons
    * During a huddle team talk we realised that our radio buttons were not appearing, once rendered. We discovered that the label element was missing from the syntax and because we were using Materialize it required an input as a child element. This was fixed. However, we then ran into further complications and had to put the input before the labels to fix the bug of the radio button dissapearing.
* Materialize
    * Being guided by our experienced group members, we all learnt that Materialize works on a grid basis. This caused problems in trying to centre our text on the navigation bar, where originally we were going to have a sign up link. However, the bugs would have needed specific media queries to iron it out and that would have been better achieved at the start of the project, we took the creative choice to drop the sign up option and present our application as more of a tool.
## Deployment
---
* The project will be deployed on github, we believed this to be the least complex method allowing us to showcase our project.
## Testing
---
* Lighthouse results: 
    * Performance = 100 
    * Accessibility = 97 
    * Best Practices = 92
    * SEO = 90
