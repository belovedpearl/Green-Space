 [Original colour pallete test using coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/05668d-427aa1-ebf2fa-679436-a5be00)
    
    Discussing the colour palette allowed us to think about the our audience and who it would appeal to, this was a first demo and we decided that muted coolours would be better suited as the greens came across quite aggressive and didn't communicate our concept as well as it could have done.
 [Final colour pallete test using coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/49c6e5-54defd-fffbfa-00bd9d-8bd7d2)
   
    We believed that this colour palette situated itself better with our concept and theme. The meanings behind the colours blue and green refer to harmony and prosperity. The blue tint evokes trustworthiness and wisdom.

## Design Choices
---
* The design choice was dictated by my ability to use the knowledge gained from the first module of the course. While presenting challenges, it allowed me to achieve a further growth in understanding of the concepts taught better.
* From the start of the program, I aimed to design a website that covers in detail concepts taught in the module.
